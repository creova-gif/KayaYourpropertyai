## Development
- **Port:** 5000 (Vite dev server)
- **Start:** `npm run dev`
- **Build:** `npm run build`

## Deployment
- **Type:** Static site
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Output directory:** `dist`

## Key Configuration
- `vite.config.ts`: Configured for Replit with `host: '0.0.0.0'`, `port: 5000`, `allowedHosts: true`
- `src/lib/supabase.ts`: Supabase client configuration (requires env vars)

## Authentication
- **Demo account:** Credentials loaded from `VITE_DEMO_EMAIL` / `VITE_DEMO_PASSWORD` env vars — bypasses Supabase, sets a mock Pro-tier landlord session (session token = `demo-session-token`)
- **Trial context:** `TrialContext` handles subscription enforcement; demo users get mocked `pro` / `active` status
- **Sign out:** Always clears local state first; skips Supabase call for demo sessions
- **OTP login:** Uses real `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp()` + `supabase.auth.verifyOtp()` — supports email and SMS (phone)
- **Token source of truth:** `supabase.auth.getSession()` — backend service and compliance service read from Supabase SDK only, never localStorage

## Security Posture (as of Mar 2026)
| ID | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CRIT-01 | CORS wildcard `origin: "*"` | ✅ Fixed — explicit origin allowlist |
| CRIT-02 | OTP accepts any 6-digit code | ✅ Fixed — real Supabase OTP/verifyOtp |
| CRIT-03 | JWT in localStorage (`kaya_access_token`) | ✅ Fixed — backend/compliance services use `supabase.auth.getSession()` |
| CRIT-04 | Rate limiter fail-open on auth routes | ✅ Fixed — auth routes return 503 when KV unavailable |
| CRIT-05 | Hardcoded credentials in source (`demo1234`) | ✅ Fixed — moved to `VITE_DEMO_EMAIL`/`VITE_DEMO_PASSWORD` env vars |
| HIGH-01 | Dual auth systems (auth.service.ts + AuthContext) | ✅ Fixed — auth.service.ts no longer used for token retrieval |
| HIGH-02 | Missing CSP + security headers | ✅ Fixed — middleware adds CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy |
| HIGH-03 | 18 endpoints expose `details: error.message` | ✅ Fixed — bulk-stripped via sed, 0 remaining |
| MEDIUM-01 | No input length limits on auth endpoints | ✅ Fixed — email ≤254, password 8–128, name 2–100 validated |
| MEDIUM-03 | No per-email account lockout | ✅ Fixed — 5 attempts/15min → 15min lockout via KV store |
| U-05/U-06 | Hardcoded "Sarah Kim" / "SK" in tenant portal | ✅ Fixed — TenantLayout + TenantProfile bound to `useAuth()` user |
